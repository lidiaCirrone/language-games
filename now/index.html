      <p class="text-left leading-6">
        Been working at MyEDU for almost 6 months now, got to delve into how
        CKEditor works (jeez) and have a closer look at Next.js. Also been
        working on a
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3MMeH7N" target="_blank">React Native app</a>
        about seasonal fruits and vegetables (mostly UI and backend) and a
        nonprofit website for an organization that helps women that are victims
        of domestic violence (not public yet). More on all of that soon!
